We are a family owned business who focuses on beard and skin care products. Bringing back time tested remedies that have fallen out of use, but are much more effective than current solutions on the market.

The main drive behind the project is the father, Gabriel. He is a pharmacist in his day to day job, and has trained in pharmaceutical compounding. He has a passion for cosmetic chemistry, and has been changing his beard oil recipe and scent over the last 12 years that he has had a beard.

His wife Janelle has been constantly supportive throughout his creative process, and helps him with feedback on all the various iterations. She helps with production, branding, and distribution.

There are 4 children old enough to help with making product, and they love to help whenever they can. Their names are written on the outside of each canof product if they help with that batch. They love to experiment and to see the process of taking raw ingredients then melting, mixing, cooling, whipping and whatever else is needed to make it into something amazing. They have made their own products including a dandelion salve that they collected dandelions for and then processed with their school, and they remain ever curious about everything they see.

We also have two cats who watch the process from afar. They are responsible for managment of the workers, and occasional sniff tests from afar to ensure that all the scents are up to their high standards.
